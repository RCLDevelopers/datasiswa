ðŸš¨ Forking this repo (please read!)
yes, with attribution.

I value keeping my work open source, but as you all know, plagiarism is bad. It's always disheartening whenever I find that someone has copied my work without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing this project, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as your own.

TL;DR
Yes, you can fork this repo. Please give me proper credit by linking back to Zangtics Digital. Thanks!
